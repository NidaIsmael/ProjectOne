            <p> Nida finds inspiration in all sorts of places—nature, books, movies, and even everyday experiences that others might miss. In her free time, she loves to paint, especially with gouache or acrylic, which lets her bring nature’s beauty to life with color and detail. It's her way of connecting with the world around her. Nida also gets inspired by movies, particularly Studio Ghibli, since their beautiful animation and landscapes give her a lot of painting inspiration. When she’s not painting, reading is another big source of inspiration and creativity. Nida enjoys classic literature, but she also loves diving into fantasy and romance novels. She’s also excited about the idea of exploring writing as another way to get creative in the future. Nida’s goal is to build a career in digital marketing, with a specific focus on data analytics. She’s interested in how businesses use data and research to understand customers and create effective marketing campaigns. She wants to combine creativity with analytics to help brands connect with people in meaningful ways. Nida is also open to exploring opportunities in social media and branding. Marketing excites her because it blends strategy and storytelling, allowing her to create campaigns that make an impact. Born and raised in the Bay Area with Yemeni roots, Nida values the diverse traditions and experiences that have shaped her identity. Growing up in such an environment has given her an appreciation for different viewpoints and strengthened her creativity and adaptability. After graduating, Nida hopes to work in data analytics, but shes also open to working in social media and branding. She’s excited to apply her skills in a professional setting and continue learning and growing in the industry. She is passionate about creativity in all forms, whether through marketing, painting, reading, or writing, and loves bringing ideas to life and connecting with people through art and storytelling.
